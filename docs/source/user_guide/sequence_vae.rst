1. Overview and Background
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section describes some advanced uses of TMNT for building different types of variational
autoencoders over input word *sequences*.  These models may be more useful for creating
topic (or *motif*) models over shorter pieces of text.  In addition, they have other interesting
properties when used *generatively*.  The work here is based on the ideas found in Zhang et al.:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04729

While implementations are available for convolutional VAEs following Zhang et al., we have
found that VAEs using the transformer architecture may perform better and provide greater flexibility
for variable-length inputs.

2. Training a Transformer-based VAE: Quick Start
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming TMNT has been installed and tested following the instructions in Installation and Quick Start,
TMNT can be used to train a transformer-based VAE, with
an invocation such as::

  mkdir _exps 
  mkdir _model_seq_vae
  python ~/tmnt/bin/seq_vae.py --input_file ./data/seq_vae/hotel_reviews.900.txt \
  --gpus 0 --gen_lr 1e-3 --min_lr 0.00002 --batch_size 450 --sent_size 64 --epochs 600 \
  --latent_dim 50 --log_interval 2 --transformer_layers 4 --save_dir ./_exps/ --kld_wt 0.1 \
  --latent_dist vmf --optimizer adam --num_units 512 --kappa 50.0 --num_heads 4 \
  --model_dir _model_seq_vae


In contrast to the bag-of-words VAE, it is strongly recommended to use GPUs to accelerate training with batch
sizes as large as memory will allow.

Note that the exact options to use will vary considerably from dataset to dataset.  The above invocation
will converge (and likely overfit) on the small sample datset of 900 text inputs.  For larger training
sets, reduce the number of epochs.  Learning rates may need to be tuned.  The ``kappa`` parameter
controls the concentration (or variance) for the ``vmf`` distribution; lower values will
prevent overfitting.  

The input file should consist of a simple text file with each individual sentence/passage of text on a separate line.
Logging output will appear in a sub-directory inside the directory path specified by ``save_dir``.
An alternative input is a json list where a text field is encoded as json string with a key
specified by the option ``json_text_key``.

The options for ``seq_vae.py`` are described below.

3. Using the Trained Model as a sequence encoder
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming TMNT has been installed a model has been trained (i.e. the files ``model.config``, ``model.params`` and
``vocab.json`` exist), text can be encoded using the
the method ``encode_text`` as follows::

  >>> from tmnt.seq_vae.runtime import SeqVAEInference
  >>> infer = SeqVAEInference('model.params', 'model.config', 'vocab.json')
  >>> infer.encode_text('just will let you know that our recent trip to la to be on the tv show " dancing with the stars " was made complete by our outstanding 3 night stay at the custom hotel . nothing was very difficult for the staff .')

The result is a single vector with size ``latent_dim``.


4. Sampling from a Trained Model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming TMNT has been installed a model has been trained (i.e. the files ``model.config``, ``model.params`` and
``vocab.json`` exist), one can generate sampled reconstructions of an input text to test the model as follows using
the method ``recode_text`` as follows::

  >>> from tmnt.seq_vae.runtime import SeqVAEInference
  >>> infer = SeqVAEInference('model.params', 'model.config', 'vocab.json')
  >>> infer.recode_text('just will let you know that our recent trip to la to be on the tv show " dancing with the stars " was made complete by our outstanding 3 night stay at the custom hotel . nothing was very difficult for the staff .')

The method will return a list of tokens representing the reconstructed text by running the text through the
full variational autoencoder, *including the stochastic step of drawing a sample from the latent distribution
before decoding the encoded input*.  This means the method is non-deterministic and may return different
results on each invocation.
