Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~

Trained models can be evaluated against a test corpus using the ``evaluate.py`` script.  An example::

  python bin/evaluate.py --test_file ./data/test.2.vec --vocab_file ./data/train.2.vocab --model_dir ./_model_dir/ --words_per_topic 10

This will provide the top N words (based on the argument to ``--words_per_topic``) for each topic to standard output.
Also, it will provide the normalized point-wise mutual information-based coherence score.


The ``evaluate.py`` script can also encode the test documents and produce an embedding visualized
using UMAP ( https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ) by simply adding the ``--plot_file`` argument
specifying the output PNG file. If the test vector file includes label indices (as the first entry on each row), these
will be mapped to colors in the plot.  If meaninful labels aren't available (i.e. the ``.vec`` file has values of
-1 for the label of each document), the scatter plot will still be generated with all points having the same color.
This is less useful, but can still be helpful to see how documents are embedded across the topic space.
Note that when using the ``plot_file`` option to generate a UMAP plot on a Mac,
typically Python must be installed as a Framework and ``pythonw`` used to interpret the program, e.g.::

  pythonw bin/evaluate.py --test_file ./data/test.2.vec --vocab_file ./data/train.2.vocab \
                          --model_dir ./_model_dir/ --words_per_topic 10 \
                          --plot_file 20news.plot.png

Note that the argument to ``--vocab_file`` must be the original (non JSON) vocab file used as the input to ``bin/train_model.py``.

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple interactive visualization of a trained topic model is possible using the ``export_model.py`` script.
This script has a few output files, but the primary visualization is done using an invocation such as::

  python bin/export_model.py --model_dir ./_model_dir/ --vec_file ./data/test.2.vec --html_vis ./20news.html

The resulting ``.html`` file should load into any browser.
