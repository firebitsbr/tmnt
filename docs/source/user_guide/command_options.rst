Scripts and Command-line Options
================================

This section provides an overview of the command-line options for the various TMNT scripts.

1. ``train_model.py``
+++++++++++++++++++++

The ``train_model.py`` script will train a single model using the configuration specified via the ``-config``
argument. This can be used to do model selection "by hand" or to retrain a model using a configuration
found via the ``select_model.py`` script. In general, given the number of hyper-parameters it is recommended
to use ``select_model.py`` to find the best topic model for a given dataset.

===================  ===========    =================================================================
Argument             Type           Description
===================  ===========    =================================================================
config               string/path    Configuration file (see :ref:`config-options-label`)
tr_vec_file          string/path    Vector file containing the training set
val_vec_file         stirng/path    Vector file containing the validation set
test_vec_file        string/path    Vector file containing the held out test set
vocab_file           string/path    Vocabulary file
save_dir             string/path    Directory for log files, model selection configs, and saved model parameters
model_dir            string/path    Override directory for model outputs (default location is a ``MODEL`` sub-directory within the argument to ``save_dir``
str_encoding         string         Character encoding to use for ``vocab_file``
hybridize            flag           When set will use the symbolic computation graph (via Gluon ``hybridize``); may train certain models faster
gpu                  integer        Logical id for the gpu (default is -1, use CPU instead)
num_final_evals      integer        Number of (final) evaluations on validation or heldout data with random initializations with (final) model configuration
eval_freq            integer        Number of training epochs in between computing perplexity and coherence on validation data
trace_file           string/path    Output file with perplexities and coherence scores computed every ``eval_freq`` epochs
topic_seed_file      string/path    JSON file that provides seed terms for topics (see :ref:`guided-label`)
===================  ===========    =================================================================

2. ``select_model.py``
++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``select_model.py`` script implements the full model selection. The hyper-parameter selection
is carried out over the validation data (provided by ``--val_vec_file``). It is recommended
to compute the final held out perplexity and coherence on a separate held out dataset using ``--tst_vec_file``.

The arguments for ``select_model.py`` overlap to a large degree with the ``train_model.py`` script.
Below are the additional arguments used by ``select_model.py``.


=====================  ===========    =================================================================
Argument               Type           Description
=====================  ===========    =================================================================
config_space           string/path    Path to the YAML file specifying the configuration space (:ref:`model-selection-label`)
budget                 integer        The budget which corresponds to the maximum number of training epochs
iterations             integer        The number of hyperband iterations
coherence_coefficient  float          The weight for coherence in the model search objective function
ns_port                integer        Force the HPBandster nameserver to use this port (default is first free port > 9000)
=====================  ===========    =================================================================

Each model selection iteration does a full hyperband sweep which involves training a number of models
with different numbers of training epochs.  For a given budget :math:`B`,
the total number of trained models is given by:

.. math::
   \sum_{x=m}^{m|3^{m+1} > B}3^m
